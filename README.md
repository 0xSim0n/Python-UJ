# Python-UJ Exercises

A collection of Python tasks from university coursework.

## Set 2 – Strings and Lists
- Count words in a multiline string.
- Insert underscores between letters in a word.
- Build strings from first/last letters of each word.
- Calculate total word length and find the longest word.
- Convert a list of numbers into a string of digits.
- Replace `"GvR"` with `"Guido van Rossum"`.
- Sort words alphabetically and by length.
- Count number of zeros in an integer.
- Format numbers into 3-digit strings (e.g. `7` → `"007"`).

## Set 3 – Syntax & Loops
- Identify syntax errors in code snippets.
- Fix incorrect list and tuple operations.
- Print numbers 0–30 excluding those divisible by 3.
- Loop: input float, print cube, stop on `"stop"`, handle errors.
- Draw a scale and rectangle using string operations.
- Perform set operations on sequences (intersection/union).
- Sum nested sequences.
- Create a Roman-to-Arabic numeral dictionary.

## Set 4 – Functions
- Turn scale and rectangle drawings into reusable functions.
- Iterative factorial and Fibonacci functions.
- In-place sublist reversal (iterative and recursive).
- Recursive sum and flattening of deeply nested sequences.

## Set 5 – Fractions (Procedural)
- `fracs.py`: functions for fraction operations and tests.

## Set 6 – Fractions (OOP)
- `fracsv2.py`: `Frac` class with methods and test code.

## Set 7 – Rectangles & Iterators
- `Rectangle` class with error handling and unit tests.
- Infinite iterators: toggle 0/1, random direction, weekly cycle.

## Set 8 – Rectangle Extensions
- Add `from_points` method and computed properties (e.g., `width`, `center`).
- Unit tests with `pytest`.

## Set 9 – Game Project
- Simple snowflake-clicker game: melt falling flakes with mouse clicks.

## Set 10 – GUI
- Dice roller GUI with button and result display.

## Set 11 – Custom Data Structures
- Extend `DoubleList` class with new methods.

## Set 12 – Stack & Queue
- Improve stack implementation using exceptions.
- Implement constant-time random queue.

## Final Project
- Find and visualize Hamiltonian cycles in a graph.
